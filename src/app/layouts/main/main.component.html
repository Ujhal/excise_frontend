        duty in form of excise duty, license fee, export pass fee, etc. 
        under the various Acts listed below. The Department also strives 
        to prevent the use of unsafe liquor and ensure consumption of liquor 
        keeping in view the health of the consumers. <br><br>The Sikkim Excise Act, 
        1992 and the Medicinal & Toilet Preparation Act 1955 enables the
